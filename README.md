# SingleTouch
This project using Capacitive Sensor buttons to capture human touch (ADC values).
These ADC values are read by some chip's ADC Pins.
Each Sensor button is configured as a keyboard's key.
STM32C8T6 processes touch evens and send it to a Computer through USB connection.
So our product now acts as an USB Device (In another words It is 'a simple keyboard USB version', each sensor button is a key button).
With this product, we can play many basic games like: Piano (8 keys), Chicken invaders, Pacman...
